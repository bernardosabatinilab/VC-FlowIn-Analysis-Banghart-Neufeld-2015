Practice Jupyter MATLAB kernel for lab meeting 060316

This repository was made as an example for lab meeting on June 3, 2016.
This is an example of how our analysis code could be put onto github following (or prior to) publication to allow others to see exactly how we analysed our data. 

It's also very useful when working on analyses with other people in the lab, or other people in the field.
